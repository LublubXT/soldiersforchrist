                <p class="color-second w-100 text-justify font-size-large font-text">I was having my devotions this morning when a question pop into my mind. Why did God make man? I sat there in my chair thinking about that question. Why did God make everything, what was the purpose? It's not like he needed to do it. Why
                    did God make man, knowing that they would just reject Him and turn their backs on Him? All these questions where going through my mind, and I needed to find answers.</p>
                <p class="color-second w-100 text-justify font-size-large font-text">My mind was thinking about these questions throughout the day, and I still didn't understand why. I was finally able to ask my Dad this evening at Church, and I asked him "Why did God make man? Why did God make everything? It's not like
                    He needed to, because He is God." He told me to look up <b>Revelations 4:11</b> which says "Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created."
                    I knew God created all things for His glory, but I still didn't understand why He would create something (humans) that would completely go against Him. I told my Dad, we humans don't ever build things on purpose to go against us, but
                    to either go against someone else or to help us with tasks. I told my dad "If I knew that what I would make would go against me in the future, then I probably wouldn't make it." and his answer was "That is why you are not God!"</p>
                <p class="color-second w-100 text-justify font-size-large font-text">I still don't understand why God would make something that would turn its back on God and reject Him. Even though I still don't completely understand why God would do that, it really got me thinking about myself and I realized what I sinner
                    I am and how I had turned my back on God and the only thing I wanted was to please myself. It also made me realize what God's love is really like, it is unlimited and it is unconditional, and even though I make horrible mistakes, God
                    still decides to love me.</p>
