                <p class="color-second w-100 text-justify font-size-large font-text">Today, while I was out, I met up the Nickolen, Bogdan, and Greg. We got talking about evolution and how things got here, and the chance of things being the way they are like DNA, and the four systems necessary for life (intake of energy,
                    using the energy, getting rid of waste, and reproduction). I asked them, out of the four systems which one developed first. Because without one system working perfectly, the organism will not thrive. The evolution theory tells us that
                    it all came by chance and things went from bad and nothing to good and something useful. We talked a lot about how things could have evolved over time, but even with all the questions I had to get him (Greg) thinking, he seemed to
                    always have an answer that wasn't really an answer.
                </p>
                <p class="color-second w-100 text-justify font-size-large font-text">We were standing outside of Nicks house talking for quite a while about religion, and it ended with them saying then don't believe and that I am not going to change their minds anytime soon, and that they don't want to talk about religion.
                    After hearing that it was very clear that I am not going to get anywhere with these guys for a while, but I hope over time as we still talk and be friends that God will open their eyes and hearts and see. Bogdan, which is the guy I
                    have talked to the least out of all of them, seems to be the most open. He told me that they are not going to change their minds right now, but maybe in the near future. I can tell the last few times I have talked to them, Bogdan is
                    always the quieter one listening and thinking about everything. The last time and this time we talked, I noticed Bogdan's face, and how it looked as if he had been crying. I have a feeling somewhere deep within me that maybe maybe
                    he is actually open, but doesn't want to show it to the other guys. I hope. I am not done with them nether is God, not even close to being done. This is only the beginning. I am not going to pray for them less or the same. I am and
                    need to be praying for them more than ever.</p>
                <p class="color-second w-100 text-justify font-size-large font-text">After the fact I felt like balling my eyes out int grief, but I knew that wouldn't help with anything and instead prayed to the God all mighty for wisdom and prayed that He would show them His terrible works and his mighty hand, and that
                    life is not pointless, and if we seek to please ourselves, we will fall. I could just picture Satan laughing like a evil madman, and telling me "Why even try anymore! Your no good! No one will listen to you! You looser!", but even
                    though all this was going through my mind I could feel the power of the almighty God fill me and gave me a new zeal for Him. Though Satan might have thought he ruined me and extinguished the fire within me, he has done the complete
                    opposite! The fire and zeal within me to tell others about Jesus is greater than it has ever been. He has not destroyed me, he added fuel to my fire!
                </p>
                <p class="color-second w-100 text-justify font-size-large font-text">I asked God a bit later to send me someone new, someone who is open and wants to hear the gospel, and I have faith that God will send me someone else. Maybe someone unexpected.</p>
                <p class="color-second w-100 text-justify font-size-large font-text">When we are rejected by other people and they don't want to listen to us, it should not discourage us, but rather it should fuel us and the desire to find someone that will listen should be higher. This is something that took me couple
                    of times to get right, because when someone would majorly embarrass me in front of a group of people I felt very hurt, and usually my dad had to help me get out of it and tell me some encouraging words. Which probably explains why
                    Jesus sent his disciples out 2 by 2, so they could encourage each other in the Lord. But I don't have that, so I have to try encourage myself in the Lord just like David did. I hope this was an encouragement to you, and a blessing,
                    and maybe a spark to reignite the fire that Satan has extinguished. The more you study God's word and spend time with Him the better you will be able to comfort yourself in the Lord. The book of Psalms is one of the best places to
                    do just that, which is why I have grown to really love and enjoy reading the book of Psalms.</p>
                <p class="color-second w-100 text-justify font-size-large font-text">Don't let Satan extinguish your fire for the Lord and the fire to reach others for Him. Press on, fight the good fight, don't waist your time with people that won't listen, finish well, and "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord,
                    and in the power of his might." (Ephesians 6:10)</p>
                <p class="color-second w-100 text-justify font-size-large font-text">God Bless you!</p>
