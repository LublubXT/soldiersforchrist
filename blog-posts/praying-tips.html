                <p class="color-second w-100 text-justify font-size-large font-text">I have prayed in different positions, locations, and ways, and I have noticed that some work better than others. Some help me focus better on what I am saying and focus on the Lord. While others don’t help me focus, my mind gets way off
                    track, and sometimes I fall asleep.

                </p>
                <p class="color-second w-100 text-justify font-size-large font-text">When I am tired, I really just want to go back to bed and fall asleep, and in these times try not to get in a position that is too comfortable. Find a position that is comfortable enough to pray. The reason for this is that if we are really
                    tired, and we are praying in a really comfortable position, we might find ourselves asleep before too long. I have done it many times when I either fall asleep or I just can’t focus, and my mind is on Mars.

                </p>
                <p class="color-second w-100 text-justify font-size-large font-text">Our position matters, and some of the best ones that I have found to work the best are walking outside (with eyes open) and talking out loud, kneeling on my knees on a stool or chair, and sitting at a table praying with my eyes closed,
                    usually having my hands on my bible and resting my head on my arms because after a while my neck starts hurting from bowing my head. The best one that I have found is walking around outside in God’s creation and talking with Him. This
                    position really helps my focus, and it makes things more realistic. Whenever I do this, I feel like God is really there, and it feels more natural too. If you think about it, this is how Adam and Eve talked with God. You don’t read
                    them kneeling down and praying with their eyes closed. Praying with your eyes open can take a bit of getting used to, but it will start feeling very natural very soon. You might be thinking, “I thought you were supposed to pray with
                    your eyes closed and hands folded?” Well, think about why you do that. We were taught to close our eyes and fold our hands to keep us from being distracted. I don’t think it would work very well if you walk around inside and pray with
                    your eyes open, because it’s less “natural”, and what I mean by this is we are not in God’s creation. Just praying outside can do wonders, and feel different, because of the surroundings, and you are seeing and hearing what God has
                    created. On the other hand, when you pray inside, you are most likely seeing and hearing things that are man made. I don’t know why it is this way, but it just is. I started praying outside this summer, and I would walk around the
                    church building a couple of times, which after a while my legs were usually tired, and I would go sit at the back of the church building and sit in the sun and talk to my Heavenly Father. I really enjoyed this, and it made me feel
                    closer to God, though you should not go off of your feelings to tell how close you are with God, but sometimes you can just feel God's presence. Sitting in the sun might have affected some things, but who knows. I would highly recommend
                    praying outside in God’s creation. It makes all the difference. If you don’t trust me, just do it yourself. Maybe not in the cold snow, but in the spring, summer, and fall. When it is warm, just try it. You will most likely want to
                    keep doing it.

                </p>
                <p class="color-second w-100 text-justify font-size-large font-text">In the winter, going outside early in the morning for about an hour might not be the best option, so I have been trying several things inside. For doing it inside and in the winter, doing the two other positions will work. They may not
                    work as well, but they will probably work better than some others. Now, I am not saying only do these. Do what works best for you, but maybe you can try some of the ones I have listed.
                </p>
                <p class="color-second w-100 text-justify font-size-large font-text">When we pray, we want to focus on what we are saying and most importantly on the Lord. Depending on what position and circumstances you are in, can affect how well you focus and can assist you in focussing. Next, we will talk about surroundings.

                </h1>
                <p class="color-second w-100 text-justify font-size-large font-text">Our surroundings can have an impact on how we pray and how focused we are while we pray. Whether it be at a desk, in your bed, on the floor, on the couch, outside on a bench, in a car, in the kitchen, or in a tree (Haven’t done that one!),
                    can influence how you pray. From different positions you get different views, sounds, and smells, and all these things can have an effect on your focusness. If you are having a hard time focusing while praying, have you thought about
                    changing your location? If we pray in the same spot and position every time, we will get used to it, and we can lose our focus. You might think that having new surroundings will distract you more, but it can actually help! That is
                    one of the reasons why I think walking and praying outside works the best, because your surroundings are always changing. If you think about Daniel in the Bible, it says in Daniel 10:6, “Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed,
                    he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.” Even Daniel was somewhat in nature praying.
                    He had his windows open. Now, it doesn’t say that he prayed with his eyes closed or open, but let's just say he had his eyes closed. The sounds and the surroundings were always changing. Now, I am not saying he did this to change his
                    surroundings, but hey, it worked! Daniel was very, very close to God. He is a good example on how we should pray and walk with God. You think of other characters in the Bible who prayed outside, Moses on the Mountain, and Jesus on
                    Mt. of Olives and other places outside, we see that praying outside is a thing, and it can give you unique experiences too.

                </p>
                <p class="color-second w-100 text-justify font-size-large font-text">When I pray outside, I feel almost closer to God. I don’t have the walls and ceilings, it’s just open space. When you hear the sounds of God’s creation, and you see what God has done, it makes a difference. Just try it sometime. Sunny
                    mornings are some of the best times to do it! It gives it a cheerful mood, and it can change your mood and what you pray about too.

                </h1>
                <p class="color-second w-100 text-justify font-size-large font-text">This morning in the Church service, one of the pastors talked about the Lord’s prayer and the Parable of the Persistent Friend. It says in Luke 11:5-10, “And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at
                    midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves; For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him? And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my
                    children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee. I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth. And I say unto
                    you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.” The word importunity
                    has the meaning of persistence. Because of the man’s persistence, his friend gave him the bread. Did God ever say how many times we can ask Him for something? No. We shouldn’t ask just one time for something, but we should continue
                    asking him for that thing until he says no or yes. The Lord wants to hear our requests, He is not like humans where they get annoyed and tired of people continuing to ask them for something. If you have asked God for something, maybe
                    it is getting over a sickness, or wanting a soul saved, and He didn’t answer your request the first time, that doesn’t mean you should quit asking. Ask until you get an answer of no, yes, or some other answer. Don’t be discouraged
                    if you don’t get an answer the first time, stay persistent.

                </p>

                </h1>
                <p class="color-second w-100 text-justify font-size-large font-text">Praying is one of the ways we spend time with the Lord, and we want to spend focused time on the Lord and not be distracted by other things. Changing the way you pray, the position you pray in, and your surroundings can have a profound
                    influence in your focusness. The way you pray, the position you pray, and your surroundings that you pray in are not important, what is important is that you get that focused time alone with the Lord and that you are praying from your
                    heart.
