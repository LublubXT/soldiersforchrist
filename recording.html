                        may sound like they have answers to everything, but just stop and think about what their answers really mean and whether they make sense or not. Evolution goes directly against the laws of science.

                        that ye have put off the old man with his deeds; And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him: Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian,
                        Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all. Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; Forbearing one another, and forgiving one
                        another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which
                        also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the
                        Lord. And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him."

                    <p class="main-text-5">Having our faith founded in God's word is crucial for having victory over your spiritual battles. Satan uses many different things to weaken our faith, but we can't let him weaken our faith. Evolution is a big thing that destroys people's
                        faith. Music is another thing, but that is for another discussion. Ungodly friends too! There are many things that satan has "created" and uses to destroy our faith! So make sure you are founded in God's word.

                    <p class="main-text-5">If we are to be true soldiers for Christ, we need to share the gospel with someone or at least give them a track. A lot if not most Christians nowadays don’t really care about sharing the gospel with others. It seems to get worse every
                        generation, and it’s not a good thing. As the population of the world grows, we should strive to tell others about the gospel more and more, not less and less. We can't stop telling the gospel to people now! We need to do more
                        now then ever! World isn't getting better!

                    <p class="main-text-5">Matthew 9:35-38 - "And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people. But when he saw the multitudes,
                        he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd. Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few; Pray ye therefore
                        the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest."
