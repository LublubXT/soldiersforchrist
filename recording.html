                    </h1>
                    <hr style="width: 75px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; border-color: #ffffff; border: none; height: 2px; background-color: #ffffff;">
                    <p class="main-text-5">1. What do you think about God? When you think about God, what comes to mind?
                    </p>
                    <p class="main-text-5">2. Who is God to you? What does God mean to you personally? Seriously, what does God mean to you? Is He simply someone you have heard about, or is He, the Lord God, everything to you?</p>
                    <p class="main-text-5">3. How often do you think about the Lord? Once a year? Once a month? Once a week? Once a day? Or do you constantly think and meditate on the Lord throughout your day? Now, how often do you think the Lord thinks about you? Once a year?
                        Once a month? Once a week? Once a day? How often? The Lord is always thinking about you. His thoughts for you number more than the sand in the sea. He thinks about you all the time!</p>
                    <p class="main-text-5">4. What if the Lord wasn't _____? What if He didn't have _____? What if the Lord wasn't long suffering? Think about that! If the Lord wasn't long suffering, we would all be dead! Time after time we make a mistake, and time after time
                        God forgives and gives us another chance. Ask yourself those two questions and fill in the blank, and think about it. If one God's characters were missing, or if He didn't have that piece of character, it would affect everything
                        else. Thank the Lord that He is _____, or that He has ____. We take God's character for granted, because we know God's character isn't going to change, so we don't need to worry about it, and just move on. But stop and think, and
                        thank and praise the Lord that He is _____ or that He has ______.</p>
                    <p class="main-text-5">If you want to learn about God, and know Him, then read the Bible. The book of Psalms is a great place to learn about God's character, because it is packed full of Psalms about the Lord. If you are having a hard time praising the Lord,
                        read the Psalms. Go through and pray through a Psalm. It works! The reason why I know what I know about the Lord, is because I read through the Psalms, and I am still reading the Psalms and learning more!</p>
                    <p class="main-text-5">Here is my challenge for you guys: Learn about the Lord. Think and meditate on Him and His word. It's great to think about the Lord, and we should think about the Lord, and we should do it often, throughout the day. Ask yourself these
                        questions. Ask yourself questions about the Lord. Think and meditate on Him. I personally love thinking and meditating on the Lord. For one, it encourages me. Two, it humbles me! When I think about the Lord and how great He is,
                        I feel like I don't know anything, and I feel like I am powerless (because I am powerless!). I just feel so small compared to the Lord! When you wake up in the morning start praising the Lord! When I wake up in the morning, the
                        first thing I think about is almost always the Lord. I wake up, and I say, "Good morning Lord!", or "Good morning Dad!" The first and last thing I try to think about in my day, is the Lord.</p>
                    <p class="main-text-5">Who/What are you going to follow? Who/What are you going to love? Who/What are you going to serve? God or mammon (riches, the world, Satan, self)? Are you ready to to do what ever God asks you to do? Are you ready to go wherever the
                        Lord asks you to go? Are you ready to die for the Lord? Are you going to pick up your cross and follow Jesus? Or are you going to follow after this world and yourself? I recommend following the Lord.</p>
                    <p class="main-text-5">Spend time with the Lord. Spend time with the Lord! I can't make you spend time with the Lord! I can say it all I want, but I can't make you follow and spend time with the Lord. You have to make the decision to follow after God. YOU
                        have start by saying, "I will..." I starts by making a decision to follow the Lord no matter what. Only you can make that decision, and I pray you do.</p>
                    <p class="main-text-5">So, when are you going to start? Ten years from now? Or are you going to start now?</p>

                        that ye have put off the old man with his deeds; And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him: Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian,
                        Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all. Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; Forbearing one another, and forgiving one
                        another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which
                        also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the
                        Lord. And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him."

                    <p class="main-text-5">Having our faith founded in God's word is crucial for having victory over your spiritual battles. Satan uses many different things to weaken our faith, but we can't let him weaken our faith. Evolution is a big thing that destroys people's
                        faith. Music is another thing, but that is for another discussion. Ungodly friends too! There are many things that satan has "created" and uses to destroy our faith! So make sure you are founded in God's word.

                    <p class="main-text-5">If we are to be true soldiers for Christ, we need to share the gospel with someone or at least give them a track. A lot if not most Christians nowadays don’t really care about sharing the gospel with others. It seems to get worse every
                        generation, and it’s not a good thing. As the population of the world grows, we should strive to tell others about the gospel more and more, not less and less. We can't stop telling the gospel to people now! We need to do more
                        now then ever! World isn't getting better!

                    </p>

                    <p class="main-text-5">Matthew 9:35-38 - "And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people. But when he saw the multitudes,
                        he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd. Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few; Pray ye therefore
                        the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest."
